Learn-A-Fact testing worksheets in LuaLaTeX

These were to help my kids study for their Learn-A-Fact (LAF) tests in 
school.  Most of them are written in LaTeX with randomizations done
by `pgfmath`.  Some of them are done in lua.  

This is not the complete set of LAF sheets.  At some point I had toyed
with the idea of generating a large set of worksheets, indexed by 
graded and level, and selling it to benefit the PTA.  But one kid finished
LAF testing three years ago and the other has one left.  So I don't know
if it'll happen.
